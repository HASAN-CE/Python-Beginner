'Write a program that shows variable re-assignment with different data types.'

# Assign an integer value to the variable 'Z'
Z = 10  # The variable 'Z' is assigned an integer value of 10
print("Z is assigned an integer value:", Z)  # Output the current value of 'Z'

# Reassign a string value to the same variable 'Z'
Z = 'Python Crash Course'  # The variable 'Z' is now reassigned to a string value
print("Z is now reassigned a string value:", Z)  # Output the new value of 'Z'

# Explanation:
# In Python, variables are dynamically typed, meaning the same variable can hold different types of data
# during its lifecycle. Here, 'Z' initially holds an integer, but is later reassigned to hold a string.
# This flexibility is a key feature of dynamically typed programming languages like Python.
