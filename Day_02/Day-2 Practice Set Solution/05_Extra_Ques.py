'Assign multiple values to multiple variables in a single line and print them.'

# Each variable (a, b, c, d, e) is assigned a corresponding value from the tuple (1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
a, b, c, d, e = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5

# Print the values of the variables in a formatted way
# The print() function accepts multiple arguments, separated by commas, and adds spaces between them
print("Values are:", a, b, c, d, e)
