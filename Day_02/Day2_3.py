# Operators:
# Arithmetic operators: +, -, /, *, etc.
# Assignment operators: =, +=, -=, etc.
# Comparison operators: ==, >, <, >=, <=, !=, etc. (Normally it returns the boolean value)
# Logical operators: and, or, not, etc.

# Example of Arithmetic operators
a = 15
b = 20
c = a + b  # Add 'a' and 'b'
print(c)   # Output: 35

# Example of Comparison operators
d = 9
print(d)   # Output: 9
d += d    # Increment 'd' by itself (d = d + d)
print(d)   # Output: 18

# Example of logical operators:
print(not(True))  # The 'not' operator returns the opposite of the given operand. Output: False
